The goal of this project is to compare 4 germline variant callers (DeepVariant, Freebayes, Strelka2 and Octopus) and produce a consensus that has a better accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) than any one caller alone. Idea is to develop a machine learning model based on various features of the read alignment. Training data will be obtained from the genome-in-a-bottle project, Illumina platinum genomes
